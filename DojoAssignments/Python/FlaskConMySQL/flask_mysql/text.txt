config = {
    'host': 'localhost',
    'database': db, # we got db as an argument
    'user': 'root',
    'password': 'root',
    'port': '3306' # change the port to match the port your SQL server is running on
}

port issue #2003 - Operational Error, due to port 3306 defined to be used and port 3307 actually working

mis-spell "localhost" - doesen't matter, as file uses IP addy, not host string name

change or alter IP addy - no error BUT the IP change makes the database URI connection time out.
